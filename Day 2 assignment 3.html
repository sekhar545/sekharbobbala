<P style="font-style: italic; color:solid-black">Tick tock...tick tock...<br/>Life is counting down on your internal clock.<br/>Memories that feel as if they occurred yesterday<br/>turn to flashes of moments that seem to fade away.<br/>People you once knew<br/>walk by without a clue.<br/>The times you once shared<br/>exist as if you were never there.
